This post describes how I created this blog website using a couple of hours.

# Objective 

The objective is to build a website using Hugo and Github Pages.

# Steps

Follow the steps listed below:

1. Create a Github account if you do not have one

1. Create a Github Repository 

  Keep in mind, you can't use user name and password to access Git Repo now.
  You have to use a token a SSH key for the sake of security.

1. Go through Hugo's Quickstart Guide

1. Go though Hugo on Github

  Make sure you delete public folder and add a .gitignore file.

1. Set up Github Action workflow

  Make sure you enable 'extended' if your theme needs.

1. Go through Github Pages, and Settings

1. Profit

  Now, you can use your favorite Editor, e.g Visual Code or Vim,  to write blogs.
