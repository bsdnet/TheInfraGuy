It will be helpful to understand modern software system like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)with fundamental security concepts. For example, symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, public/private key, digital signature, certificate and signing.

# Objective

Use diagram to illustrate critical security concepts used in modern software.

# Concepts

## Encryption

Symmetri encryption uses same key for both encryption and decryption; while asymmetric encryption use different but mathematically relatedkeys for enryption and decryption.
